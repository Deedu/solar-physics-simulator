        Reasoning: We get DNI in, W/m^2, which is power per unit of area.
        This collector has a given efficiency of turning that solar energy into
        thermal energy in the water. I may not know that conversion rate very well
        (it changes over time with relative temperatures of water, condition of panels, etc.)
        but I could make a conservative assumption and run with it.

        I take the DNI in, multiply by efficiency of conversion, that gives me the
        energy that I am adding to the system, through the water.

        How I allocate that energy depends on the flow rate, i.e. slow moving water will get hotter
        and fast moving water will not get as hot, but a greater volume of water will be heated
